      return f"{doctor['primary_specialty']} specialist at {doctor['hospital_affiliation']} in {doctor['location']}. 
              Expertise: {doctor['sub_specialty']}. {doctor['critical_surgeries_summary']} 
              {doctor['special_interests_and_expertise']} 
              {doctor['years_of_experience']} years experience.
